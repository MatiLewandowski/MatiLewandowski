### Hi all! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mateusz Lewandowski and I'm currently working for Wartsila as an Automation & Electrical Engineer. What I find most interesting about my job is the software part. That's why I decided to start learning Python, SQL & GIT! I've done some courses on my own and now I'm developing some projects on my own. My goal is to start working in IT industry pretty soon. Learning still in progress!
